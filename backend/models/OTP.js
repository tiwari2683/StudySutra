// What is .pre("save", ...)?
//This is a Mongoose pre-save middleware â€” it runs before a document is saved to the database.
//pre and post hooks are used to perform actions before and after certain events in mongoose
//pre hooks are used to perform actions before certain events like save, update, delete etc.
//post hooks are used to perform actions after certain events like save, update, delete etc.
//used below schema and above to model
